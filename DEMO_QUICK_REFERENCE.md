## üí¨ KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"Next-Gen IDS with A-RNN adaptive pattern learning, explainable AI, and blockchain security. Detects IoT attacks with 95%+ accuracy while explaining how to stop them."*

### Architecture (1 minute)
1. **A-RNN**: Learns WHAT patterns matter (attention + gating)
2. **S-LSTM + CNN**: Temporal + spatial classification
3. **Explainability**: SHAP + AI explanations
4. **Blockchain**: Immutable audit trail

### Why It Matters (30 seconds)
*"IoT devices are vulnerable. Traditional IDS can't adapt. This system learns attack patterns dynamically and explains them to human analysts."*

## ‚ùì EXPECTED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why A-RNN?**
*A: Adaptive attention learns which features/timesteps contain attacks. +3-5% accuracy vs baseline.*

**Q: Blockchain purpose?**
*A: Immutable audit trail. Attackers can't delete logs without detection.*

**Q: Real-time capable?**
*A: Yes. ~10ms inference on CPU, <1ms on GPU.*

**Q: False positives?**
*A: Adjustable threshold. Confusion matrix shows FP rate. Typically <5%.*

**Q: Zero-day attacks?**
*A: A-RNN's adaptive learning helps detect novel patterns, but fine-tuning recommended.*
